# My First Python Script

This repository contains my first Python Scripts, part of my learning journey in the Data Bootcamp with Just IT.

## Using Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook

To create this scripts, I used Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab versions for interactive exploration:

## Overview

The script covers some basic Python commands like:

- **Print Statement:**

    ```python
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```

- **Variables:**

    ```python
    name = "John"
    age = 25
    ```

- **User Input:**

    ```python
    user_input = input("Enter your name: ")
    ```

- **Loops:**

    ```python
    for i in range(5):
        print(i)
    ```

- **List:**

    ```python
    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
    ```

- **Functions:**

    ```python
    def greet(name):
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")
    ```

Feel free to explore it!
