# My First Python Script

This repository contains my first Python Script, part of my learning journey in the Data Bootcamp with Just IT.

## Using Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook

I created Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab versions of the script for interactive exploration:

- [basic_commands.ipynb](basic_commands.ipynb) - Jupyter Notebook version.
- [basic_commands_google_colab.ipynb](basic_commands_google_colab.ipynb) - Google Colab version.

Feel free to open and run these notebooks in your preferred environment.

## Overview

The `basic_commands.py` script covers the following basic Python commands:

- **Print Statement:**

    ```python
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```

- **Variables:**

    ```python
    name = "John"
    age = 25
    ```

- **User Input:**

    ```python
    user_input = input("Enter your name: ")
    ```

- **Conditional Statements:**

    ```python
    if age >= 18:
        print("You are an adult.")
    else:
        print("You are a minor.")
    ```

- **Loops:**

    ```python
    for i in range(5):
        print(i)
    ```

- **List:**

    ```python
    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
    ```

- **Functions:**

    ```python
    def greet(name):
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")
    ```
